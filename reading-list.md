    - Section 2.1 discusses features in compiled code: Data Structures and Algorithms, Compiler and System Information, Programming skill and System knowledge, Choice of System Calls (aka libraries and APIs), and Errors.
    - Section 2.2 discusses features in source code and may be applicable to scripting languages: (several not included here...), Use of language features, Scoping, Execution paths, Bugs, and Metrics.
    - Sections 3 and 4 discuss some of the problems that may be encountered with authorship analysis, such as code reuse and multi-author code projects.

    - "A goal of our research was to extract more granular file features from different domains than the usual IOCs cover, in a sense, more 'expensive' features, that we considered less volatile than domain names. This way we expected to be able to find links among different events contained in MISP, that the usual indicators miss. In a targeted operation, it is considered expensive to change a toolset, rewrite malware or switch infection vectors like for example the purchase of a new exploit. Currently used indicators lack capabilities to describe 'expensive metrics', hence the idea to widen the feature space."
